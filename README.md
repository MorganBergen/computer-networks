##  Description

The first course on computer networks.  Includes the basics of computer networking, various protocols, socket programming, etc.  Topics covered include physical layer (wired and wireless), medium access control and data link layers, packet switching and routing (IP), routing protocols, transport layer (TCP, UDP), congestion and flow control, basic network security, and network applications.
