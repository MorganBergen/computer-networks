##  network layer:  data plane

###  roadmap

-  network layer overview
    +  data plane
    +  control plane
-  what's inside a router
    +  input ports, switching, output ports
    +  buffer management, scheduling
-  ip:  the internet protocol
    +  datagram format
    +  addressing
    +  network address translation
    +  ipv6
-  generalized forwarding, sdn
    +  match + action
    +  openflow:  match + action in action
-  middleboxes

###  data plane our goals

###  network layer services and protocols

-  transport segment from sending to receiving host
    +  sender:  encapsulates segments into datagrams, passes to link layer
    +  receiver:  delivers segments to transport layer protocol

###  two key network-layer functions

**network-layer functions**
-  forwarding:  move packets from a router's input link to a router's input link to the appropriate router output link
-  routing:  determine route taken by packets from source to destination
    +  routing algorithms

**analogy:  taking a trip**
-  forwarding:  process of getting through a single interchange
-  routing:  process of planning a trip from source to destination

###  network layer:  data plane, control plane

###  per-router control plane

###  software defined networking sdn control plane

###  network service model

**question**:  what service model for channel transporting datagrams from sender to receiver?

###  network-layer service model

###  reflections on best-effort service

###  router architecture overview

###  input port functions

###  destination-based forwarding

###  longest prefix matching

###  switching fabric

###  switching via memory

###  switching via a bus

###  switching via interconnection network

###  input port queuing

###  output port queuing

###  buffer management

###  packet scheduling:  first come first served

###  scheduling policies:  priority scheduling

###  scheduling policies:  round robin

###  scheduling policies:  weighted fair queuing
