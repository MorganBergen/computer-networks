#  interactive problem

consider the router and the three attached subnets below (a, b, c).  the number of hosts is also shown below.  the subnets share a 24 high order bits of the address space: 10.81.218.0

assign subnet address to each of the subnets (a, b, c) so that the amount of address space assigned is minimal, and at the same time leaving the largest possible contiguous address space available for assignment if a new subnet 


$2^n - 2 = 2^8 - 2 = 254$ 

```
  32 - 24 = 8, remaining 8 bits can be used for the host part
 
  octet: 10.18.2.18.0 through 10.18.2.18.255

  [128 ][ 32 ][ 16 ][ 8 ][ 4 ][ 2 ][ 1 ]
```

```
network address
host range address
broadcast address
```

3.  what is the starting address of subnet a? what is the ending address of subnet a?

`a - 32 -> 32 + 2 = 34`

`64 - 2 = 62 hosts addressable`

`[128 ][ 64 ][ 32 ][ 16 ][ 8 ][ 4 ][ 2 ][ 1 ]`

` 2^7    2^6   2^5   2^4   2^3  2^2  2^1  2^0`

network address -> `10.81.218.0/26`

host range address -> `10.81.218.1` through `10.81.218.62`

broadcast address -> `10.81.218.63`

broadcast numbers will always be odd

4.  what is the network address, host range address, and broadcast address for subnet b if b wants 98 hosts?

subnet b has 98 hosts, so it will need at least
